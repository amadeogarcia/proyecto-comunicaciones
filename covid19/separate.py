extract_substr(s, open, close, start):
    This function finds and returns the first occurrence of a substring of s preceded by open and followed by close.
    Also returns the position in which substring ends, easing the process of searching recursively the same substring.
    When no substring is valid, returns "ERR".

    EXAMPLE:
    >>> s = "Hello <b>World</b>!"
    >>> substr_1 = extract_substr(s, '<b>', '</b>', 0)
    >>> substr_1
    'World'
